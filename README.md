## Employee Manager

The idea of the project is to develop a web-based employee manager system. The system will contain information about jobs, organizations and employees. The system will provide different types of reposts like (for example):

- display top 5 employees from Dreamix with top skill Java Security
- display all employees from VM Ware
- display all employees from Endava hired last month
- display all employees hired for at least one year with keyword "media" in their job description
etc.
